# codeproject
Repository for Code for my 3rd Year Project on Statistical Machine Learning (4IR)

I have uploaded my code onto GitHub to reduce the file size of the overall pdf that I will have to submit.
The repository for the codes I have used to create the models and plots for the tree-based methods can be found in the following repository:

https://github.com/luangamornlertp/codeproject/

The codes have been split into two similar to that in chapter 6 of this report, CLASSIFICATION and REGRESSION which makes each dataset easy to follow.

Furthermore, one can find the TeX file for the report in the following repository:

https://github.com/luangamornlertp/Project/maintreedraft.tex

The reader is free to download the codes and play around with it if they so choose.
